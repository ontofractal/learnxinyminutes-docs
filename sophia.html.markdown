Sophia is a strongly-typed ML-style functional language developed for writing smart contracts for the Aeternity blockchain. Sophia design choices were based on the need to restrict mutable state, reduce number of side effects, better handling of concurrency, and ease of debugging and testing.

Aeternity VM is built with Erlang programming language and Sophia also shares a lot of qualities with Erlang and Erlang VM.
